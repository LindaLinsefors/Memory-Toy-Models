"""Hybrid hand-coded / trained model built on HandCodedModel2.

HybridModel2 keeps the analytically constructed MLP *up* matrix of
HandCodedModel2 (built by exactly the same code path, so all settings — S,
top_n / top_fraction, tie-breaking randomness, connection matrix — apply
unchanged) but throws away the hand-coded *down* matrix. The down matrix and
bias are instead randomly initialised (nn.Linear-style uniform) and trained
with full-batch cross-entropy while the up matrix stays frozen.

Because the up matrix is frozen, the hidden activations for the fact set are
constant throughout training. train_down_matrix therefore precomputes them
once and each epoch is just a linear layer + CE — training cost is
O(n_facts * d_ff * n_labels) per epoch regardless of input vocab size.

Training recipe (deliberate, matching the repo's conventions): plain Adam,
no weight decay, no gradient clipping, full-batch CE loss. Early stopping on
best_guess_accuracy: stop at 1.0, or when it hasn't improved for `patience`
epochs.
